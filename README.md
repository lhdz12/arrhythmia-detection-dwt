# ECG PVC Arrhythmia Detection Using Discrete Wavelet Transform 
--- 
Author: Laurie Hernández

This project is a Python based arrhythmia detector, using the Discrete Wavelet Transform as a method to decompose frequencies in ECG samples from the MIT-BIH database, in order to classify heartbeats as normal or arrhythmic. The project's purpose is to identify Arrhythmias using DWT, with a demonstration of how this mathematical approach, even though simple, is useful and provides a high accuracy level and could, on the long run be a good alternative for healthcare centers that seek immediate care with no other resources available.
